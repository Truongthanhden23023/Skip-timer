-- Assume there's a global variable controlling the timer during the game
local gameTimer = 60  -- For example, 60 seconds for each round

-- Function to simulate the timer countdown
function startGameTimer()
    while gameTimer > 0 do
        print("Time left in game: " .. gameTimer)
        gameTimer = gameTimer - 1
        os.execute("sleep 1")  -- Simulate waiting 1 second (adjust for real timing in the game)
    end
    print("Round over!")
end

-- Function to skip the timer (set the game timer to 0 immediately)
function skipGameTimer()
    gameTimer = 0
    print("Timer skipped! Round ends immediately.")
end
